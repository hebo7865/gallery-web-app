Project Overview:
This project is a simple E-commerce Products Gallery built with Angular 17 and styled using Tailwind CSS. It displays a list of product categories, allows users to filter products by category, and includes a search bar and sorting options (by name and price).

The UI includes:
A responsive layout using Tailwind Grid and Flex utilities
Loading indicators while fetching data
Empty state screens for no results or failed API calls
Clickable categories to filter products
Search bar with live filtering
Dropdown menu to sort products (A-Z, price high-to-low, low-to-high)
Product details navigation
This project aims to demonstrate:
Component-based architecture in Angular
State handling with clean conditional rendering
Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
UX considerations like error fallback UI and visual feedback
